# phase1-projectartistsAtMetApp

app to show art and artists at the Metroploitan Museum of Art

Will utilize the Metropolitan Museum of Art API (all rights reserved to respective owners of artworks)
The MET also provides a csv file which may be used in conjunction with this app, will decide as app progresses
The app should have a search function of artworks, artists names, Titles, is a highlight of museum, possible to which works "include on display".
The app should also include several eventlisteners such as click, submit, hover or thumbnail of work or enlarge work, not sure yet, likes function as well

In addition my first blog that helped me figure out soe of the aspects of the first project https://medium.com/@ianscottmartin/my-javascript-journey-9b3bf8423870.

Introduction
Welcome to JavaScript Project Mode!

You’ve worked so hard to get here and have learned a ton. Now it's time to bring it all together!

For this project, you're going build a Single Page Application (SPA). Building this application will be challenging because it will integrate everything you've learned up to this point. Your frontend will be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and will communicate with a public API.

Project Requirements
Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API or from a db.json file using json-server. Your API or db.json should return a collection of at least 5 objects with each object having at least 3 attributes. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format. Try to avoid using an API that requires a key. APIs that are free and require no authorization will be easiest to use. For ideas, see this list of no-auth APIsLinks to an external site.. If you would like to use an API that requires a key, please consult with your instructor on how to protect that key. NEVER push your API key to github!

Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects or reloads. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

Use at least 2 distinct event listenersLinks to an external site. (2 events of different types) that enable interactivity. What this means is that, if you had 2 click events, that would only count as 1 distinct event and you would need to add at least 1 more. Think search or filter functionality, toggling dark/light mode, upvoting posts, etc. Each of your event listeners should also have its own unique callback function. These must be added using JavaScript's .addEventListener() method. Events embedded into HTML elements and CSS will not count toward the total. Please ask your instructor if you have questions regarding this requirement.

Your project must implement at least one instance of array iteration using available array methods (map, forEach, filter, etc). Manipulating your API data in some way should present an opportunity to implement your array iteration.

Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.

Stretch Goals
Use json-serverLinks to an external site. in your project to persist your app's interactivity.
Use 3 or more event listeners.
We also expect you to complete the following items prior to turning in your project:
[GITHUB REPOSITORY]: A well-written informative README.md file. This is the business card of your project and you really want it to look great! A template can be found here: makeareadme.comLinks to an external site.. Some additional considerations:
If you used someone else's pictures or material please make sure you give them credit in your README.
If you think your blog post and/or video are really good and would add value, add them to your README.md.
If you want to go above and beyond, record a few seconds of yourself navigating the app and turn it into a gif. Then, add the gif in your README.md. That way anyone can get a sense of how your app works without leaving the README's page on GitHub!
[GITHUB REPOSITORY]: A detailed commit history (30+ commits is your minimum goal). Committing frequently is a fundamental best practice that you want to acquire as soon as possible. One day you will be collaborating on projects and you'll notice the importance of committing even more. Commit messages should be in the present tense, 50 characters or less and they should describe the changes you are committing.
A video walkthrough of your app — MUST be no longer than 3 minutes. In the video try to sound as professional as possible and walk through the functionality you built. A common way to record the video is to open a zoom meeting, share your screen, and then hit "record". Once the recording has been downloaded to your computer, upload it to YouTube Studio as "unlisted". That way only people with the link will be able to watch it. You don't have to share the video with anyone other than your instructors if you don't feel comfortable.
A blog post about this phase of the curriculum. This will serve as one of the four blogs you are required to complete to graduate. Please use these blogging guidelinesLinks to an external site. as you start your first blog.
Strategy, Timeline, and Tips
Planning
Plan out your features
Develop user stories
“As [ a user ], I want [ to perform this action ] so that [ I can accomplish this goal ].”
Features should not need you there to explain them to users
Plan out the structure of your JSON requests
Project Pitches
It's recommended that before you start working on your project, you create a pitch for your project idea. You can choose to pitch that project to instructors during a Lab Help Session as well if you would like feedback before starting.

For your project pitch, you should include:

The basic story of your application
The core features of your MVP
The API data you'll be using and how you'll use it
Challenges you expect to face
How you are meeting the requirements of the project
